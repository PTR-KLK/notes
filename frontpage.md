I'm Piotr Kielak, without vowels it's PTR KLK, thus my nickname.

I'm a Frontend Developer and also an avid DIY enthusiast.

This digital garden is a text log of my adventures in programming, computer hardware, and other ideas that spark in my mind. It's a place for my shared [[projects]], [[articles]] and [[loose thoughts]].

Check out [[about]] and [[contact]] pages for more additional info.
