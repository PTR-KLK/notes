## Beginnings

It started from reading one conversation on [Hackerspace Pomorze slack](https://hs3city.slack.com/) about taking notes and tools for aggregating them. Someone posted a link to [the notion note with a list of knowledge management tools](https://www.notion.so/Artificial-Brain-Networked-notebook-app-a131b468fc6f43218fb8105430304709).

It inspired me to dig deeper into this topic. I read two articles about digital gardens: [link](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/) and [link](https://tomcritchlow.com/2019/02/17/building-digital-garden/). I got inspired by them even more. Mainly because of a looser approach to presenting the information. Also, I could show the structure of my notes with the graph, because network graphs are cool.

I got inspired, but how about tools? The list that I mentioned earlier could be handy, but my search for tools hasn't ended to this point. I also stumbled upon *[a collective of gardeners publicly tending their digital notes on the interwebs](https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners)*. I reckoned that I could make my garden in GatsbyJS, in which I have some experience.
